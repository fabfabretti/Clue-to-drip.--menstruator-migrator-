# ðŸ©¸ clue-to-drip ðŸ©¸ (menstruator migrator)
A simple tool that allows you to smoothly import all of your data from [Clue](https://helloclue.com/) into [drip.](https://bloodyhealth.gitlab.io/index.html). <br>Supports all types of bleeding data and most tags!
<br><br> While not finished yet, the core functionality is already available at [https://fabfabretti.github.io/clue-to-drip/](https://fabfabretti.github.io/clue-to-drip/). :)

## Current tag equivalence
As not all tags available in Clue are also available in drip., the extra data is stored in the note.value column.
| Clue   |      Drip      |
|----------|:-------------:|
| a        |   b           |

## Upcoming
> [!NOTE]  
> While the tool is functional, testing was very limited because of the difficulty in getting my hands on Clue data. If you want to help, I'd be more than happy to get some more data to test on!
* A decent UI is on its way, I promise
* Excluded cycle data
* Checks on input file
* Birth-control related tags (currently, all tags except custon tags and these ones are already supported)
