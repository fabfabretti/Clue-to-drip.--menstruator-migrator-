# ðŸ©¸ clue-to-drip ðŸ©¸ (menstruator migrator)
A simple tool that allows you to smoothly import all of your data from [Clue](https://helloclue.com/) into [drip.](https://bloodyhealth.gitlab.io/index.html). Supports all types of bleeding data and most tags!
<br><br> While not finished yet, the core functionality is already available at [https://fabfabretti.github.io/clue-to-drip/](https://fabfabretti.github.io/clue-to-drip/). :)

## Upcoming
> [!NOTE]  
> While the tool is functional, testing was very limited because of the difficulty in getting my hands on Clue data. If you want to help, I'd be more than happy to get some more data to test on!
* A (decent) UI is on its way, I promise
* Excluded cycle data
* Checks on input file
